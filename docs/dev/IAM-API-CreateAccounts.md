## Description

If the connected user is granted the dedicated right, he has the possibility to create an account in the system using the POST /iam/account route. id of the account will be generated by the system, name is mandatory in the payload. As of now, the creation of a root account is not covered by this process (root accounts are onboarded manually) so only subsidiary accounts can be created this way. parent_id field is the account_id the user is logged with

## Acceptance Crtieria

*When* I call the POST /iam/account route with payload {"name": "TBC-UK"}

*Then* an account with name "TBC-UK" is created and its parent_id is the TBC account_id
